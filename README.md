NCLab Capstone project
Hangman
Built with Python

Welcome to my Hangman game written in Python! I wanted to make this simple hangman game to challenge myself and create something fun.
The game goes by classic rules: The user has six tries to guess letters to try and find a hidden word.

You can add or delete possible words from the words list by editing the Word.py file

When the game is run:
1. It will ask for your name and welcome you to Hangman
2. The game will display the current status of your hangman and underscores showing how many letters the hidden word is. You will also be prompted to enter a letter
3. After you enter a letter, press the Enter key, and you will be notified if the letter was in the word or not
4. Keep guessing letters until you find the word or run out of guesses
5. When the game ends you will be given a choice to play again

Pull requests are welcome!
Please let me know of interesting changes to the gameplay or other ways to make it a more fun and enjoyable experience!
